# VERSION 1

This file does two things:

- First: it changes all names of the JPEG files to "Image 1", "Image 2", "Image X"...for X files in folder.

- Second: it creates two more JPEG files in that folder for each picture:

	- black & white high quality, less size.
	- RGB high quality, less size.

(These new files are called "image-X-low" and "image-X-gray")

In the future I will add the option to choose the origin and output file paths.
